some configs inspired from https://github.com/XNM1/linux-nixos-hyprland-config-dotfile

fcitx5-configtool to configure mozc and pinyin is required
(or you can use my configurations, which are already symlinked)

I installed hyprprop using nix-env because it's not replicable

qt5ct has to be run to configure: config files have permanant links
kvantummanager has to be run to select qt5 theme
